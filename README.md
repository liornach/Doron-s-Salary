## Salary Calculator

This is a C script that calculates the salary for a specific job based on the user-entered shift information. The script prompts the user to enter their name and the shift details (start time, end time) in the command line, and then calculates the total salary based on the shift hours worked.
Currently, this project is working only for one specefic job. If you have any requests, feel free to contact me by mail - lior54nach@gmail.com. I'll ajust the script for your specefic job and send it over to you.
